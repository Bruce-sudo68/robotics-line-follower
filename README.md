# Line-Following Robot Simulation
This project is a Python-based simulation of an autonomous line-following robot, developed using the Pygame library. It serves as a practical exploration into the foundational principles of robotics, including sensor integration, real-time data processing, and basic control systems.

My primary goal was to build a functional model that could autonomously navigate a defined track, which allowed me to apply theoretical concepts from physics and computer science to a tangible problem. The development process was an iterative journey of problem-solving, debugging, and refining algorithms, significantly deepening my understanding of how robots perceive their environment and make decisions.
